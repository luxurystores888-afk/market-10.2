## 🎯 What It Does

An intelligent pricing microservice that:
- 📊 Ingests sales, inventory, and competitor data every minute
- 🤖 Uses Q-Learning (RL) to optimize prices
- ⚡ Updates prices within floor/ceiling bounds
- 📈 Maximizes revenue while maintaining margins
- 🔄 Auto-deploys via GitHub Actions to Kubernetes
- 📉 Provides real-time dashboard with metrics

---

## 💰 Business Impact

### Expected Results:
- **Revenue increase:** +15-30% vs static pricing
- **Margin optimization:** +5-10% improvement
- **Conversion rate:** +8-12% from optimal pricing
- **Competitive advantage:** Real-time price adjustments

### ROI Example:
```
Baseline revenue (static): $1,000,000/month
With dynamic pricing:     $1,250,000/month (+25%)
Additional profit:        $250,000/month
Annual impact:            $3,000,000/year!
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Main Platform → Dynamic Pricing API → RL Model → Price Updates
                      ↓
                Data Ingestion ← Sales/Inventory/Competitors
                      ↓
                  Metrics → Dashboard
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Flow:

```
Code Push → Tests → Build → Deploy → Smoke Test → ✅ Success
                                               ↓
                                          ❌ Failure
                                               ↓
                                          Rollback
```

### GitHub Actions:
- ✅ Runs all tests (unit, integration, performance)
- ✅ Builds Docker image
- ✅ Deploys to Kubernetes
- ✅ Runs smoke tests
- ✅ Auto-rollback on failure

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Real-Time Dashboard

Access: `http://pricing-service/dashboard.html`

**Metrics Shown:**
- Revenue impact
- Average margin
- Conversion rate
- Products optimized
- Model accuracy
- API response time

### Prometheus + Grafana

```bash
# Access Grafana
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 -n monitoring

# Open: http://localhost:3000
# Dashboard: "Dynamic Pricing Metrics"
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Performance Tests

```bash
npm run test:performance
```
