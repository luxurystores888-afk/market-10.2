## 🔍 **WHAT'S FAKE/NOT REAL:**

### ❌ **Things That Are NOT in the Code:**

- Customer reviews (until customers write them)
- Order history (until real orders)
- Social proof stats (until real sales)

**The CODE is real, the DATA is placeholder!**

### **Not Implemented (Didn't create because not requested):**
- Blockchain smart contracts (mentioned but not built)
- NFT minting (component exists, needs Web3 setup)
- Some advanced AI features (need OpenAI API)

**If it's not in a file, I didn't make it!**
