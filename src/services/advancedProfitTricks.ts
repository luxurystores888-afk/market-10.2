 * How it works:
 * Customer orders burger ($5)
 * You ask: "Would you like fries with that?" (+$3)
 * They say yes (70% do!)
 * You ask: "Make it a large for just $1 more?" (+$1)
 * They say yes (60% do!)

 * 
 * Your implementation:
 * - Sell one popular product at cost (0% margin)
 * - Upsell related products (50% margin)
 * - Bundle deals (40% margin)
 * - Subscriptions (60% margin)
 * 
 * Result: 10x customer lifetime value

 * 1-9 items: $10 each
 * 10-49 items: $9 each (save 10%)
 * 50-99 items: $8 each (save 20%)
 * 100+ items: $7 each (save 30%)
 * 
 * Psychology: Bulk buying feels like savings
 * Reality: You sell MORE volume at GOOD margin
 * 
 * Example:
 * Before: Customer buys 5 @ $10 = $50
 * After: Customer buys 10 @ $9 = $90 (+80% revenue!)
 * Your cost: $6 per item
 * Profit: $50 - $30 = $20 vs $40 - $30 = $10 before
 * Doubled profit + doubled sales!

 * TRICK 4: ABANDONED CART RECOVERY (Shopify merchants make $260M/year with this)

 * 1. Customer adds to cart → Leaves

 * 3. After 24 hours → Email: "Come back - 10% OFF!" (8% recovery)
 * 4. After 3 days → Email: "Last chance - 15% OFF!" (15% recovery)
 * 
 * Reality:
 * 70% of carts are abandoned ($350B/year in USA alone!)
 * Recover even 10% = Massive profit
 * 
 * Example:
 * Daily cart abandonments: 100 carts × $80 avg = $8,000 abandoned
 * Recovery rate: 12% = 12 carts = $960/day recovered
 * Monthly: $28,800 extra revenue!

 * TRICK 5: FLASH SALES (Creates buying frenzy)
 *

 * 
 * How it works:
 * Normal day: 100 sales

 * 
 * Psychology: FOMO + Urgency + Scarcity
 * 
 * Best practices:
 * - Duration: 2-24 hours (not too long)
 * - Discount: 30-50% (significant)
 * - Announce: 1 day before (build anticipation)
 * - Limit: "First 100 customers only"
 * - Timer: Countdown on page
 * - Email blast: To entire list
 * - Social media: Posts + ads
 * 
 * REAL example (Amazon Prime Day):
 * Normal day: $30M
 * Prime Day: $500M (16x!)
 * 
 * Your scale:
 * Normal day: $1,000
 * Flash sale: $3,000 (3x)

 * 
 * RIGHT way (add middle tier):
 * Basic: $10

 * Result: 40% choose Premium! (feels like best value vs Standard)

 * Science: "Goldilocks effect" - people avoid extremes

 * Psychology: They already committed to buying
 * Adding one more item feels small
 *

 * - 18% of customers add post-purchase item
 * - Average add: $15-30
 * - Costs you: $0 (just an offer)
 * 
 * Example:
 * 100 orders/day

 * 
 * Reality: You charge $8 shipping for $10 product
 * Customer feels they got deal
